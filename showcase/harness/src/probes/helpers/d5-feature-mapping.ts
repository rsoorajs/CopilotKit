/**
 * D5 — registry-feature-id → D5-feature-type mapping.
 *
 * The Railway `railway-services` discovery source populates each
 * service's record with a `demos: string[]` field — the demo IDs from
 * `showcase/shared/feature-registry.json` joined by integration slug.
 * The D5 (`e2e-deep`) and D6 (`e2e-parity`) drivers, however, fan out
 * over the closed `D5FeatureType` enum from `helpers/d5-registry.ts`.
 *
 * Most demo IDs do not match the D5 feature type names verbatim —
 * `tool-rendering-default-catchall`, `hitl-in-chat`, `hitl-in-app`,
 * `gen-ui-tool-based`, `headless-simple`, etc. all describe demo
 * routes whose D5 conversation script is registered against a
 * different `D5FeatureType` literal. Without an explicit mapping
 * every service's `demos[]` would silently fail the
 * `isKnownFeatureType` filter in the driver and the driver would
 * short-circuit "no D5 features declared" green.
 *
 * Source of truth for which D5 feature types each demo maps to:
 *
 *   - The D5 script files under `src/probes/scripts/d5-*.ts` declare
 *     their `featureTypes` literal — that's the closed set of D5
 *     types the registry can hold.
 *   - The registry's demo IDs that share semantics with one of those
 *     types are declared here. Many registry IDs map to the same D5
 *     type (many-to-one); a few map to multiple D5 types (one-to-many,
 *     e.g. `shared-state-read-write` covers both read and write).
 *
 * Demo IDs not in this map are silently dropped — D5 covers a closed
 * set and registry features outside it (e.g. `auth`,
 * `multimodal`, `byoc-*`) have no D5 conversation script.

 *   - `hitl-text-input`        : 2 demos (in-chat HITL variants using useHumanInTheLoop)
 *   - `hitl-steps`             : 1 demo (step-selection confirmation)
 *   - `hitl-approve-deny`      : 1 demo (modal/in-app approval)
 *   - `shared-state-read|write`: 1 demo, 2 D5 types (one-to-many)
 *   - `mcp-apps`               : 1 demo
 *   - `subagents`              : 1 demo
